The package also includes a pristine-gz command, which can regenerate a pristine .gz file, a pristine-bz2 for .bz2 files, and a pristine-xz for .xz files. The delta file is designed to be checked into revision control along-side the upstream branch, thus allowing Debian packages to be built entirely using sources in revision control, without the need to keep copies of upstream tarballs.} maintainers {gmx.de:Torsten.Maehne openmaintainer} license GPL-2+ categories archivers version b89a403 revision 1
