The package also includes a pristine-gz command, which can regenerate a pristine .gz file, a pristine-bz2 for .bz2 files, and a pristine-xz for .xz files. The delta file is designed to be checked into revision control along-side the upstream branch, thus allowing Debian packages to be built entirely using sources in revision control, without the need to keep copies of upstream tarballs.} maintainers {gmx.de:Torsten.Maehne openmaintainer} license GPL-2+ categories archivers version b74af91 revision 1

These changes (deltas) are similar to the output of the {"diff"} program in that they may be used to store and transmit only the changes between files. However, unlike diff, the output of Xdelta is not expressed in a human-readable format--Xdelta can also also apply these deltas to a copy of the original file. Xdelta uses a fast, linear algorithm and performs well on both binary and text files. This is a port of the old stable Xdelta-1.1 maintenance release series. New development happens in the Xdelta-3.0 release series, which is available via the {"xdelta"} port.} maintainers {gmx.de:Torsten.Maehne openmaintainer} license GPL-2 categories archivers version 1.1.4 revision 0
