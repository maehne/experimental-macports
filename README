This repository contains experimental port recipes for MacPorts
<http://www.macports.org/>. These recipes either fix bugs in ports
already present in MacPorts and reported to its bug tracker
<http://trac.macports.org/> or they provide new ports, which have not
yet been accepted into the MacPorts repository. That means that
recipes will disappear from this repository once they have been
migrated or have been superseded by the ports available via
"port selfupdate" from the MacPorts repository.


Currently, this repository contains the following new ports:

mars @4.3 (java, devel)
    MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

    UNRELEASED

pristine-tar @b74af91 (archivers)
    Regenerate a pristine upstream tarball from a binary delta file and
    a revision control checkout

    UNRELEASED

xdelta1 @1.1.4 (archivers)
    Xdelta -- A binary delta generator (old stable maintenance release)

    See ticket #35395: Xdelta -- A binary delta generator (old stable
        maintenance release)


Currently, this repository contains the following updated ports:

cvs2svn @2.4.0_1
    cvs2svn is a Python script that converts a CVS repository to a
    Subversion repository.

    Applied patch from ticket #33190 "cvs2svn depends on python26",
    which adds variants for the different Python versions.

gtkwave @3.3.44 (cad)
    A viewer for common electronic CAD waveform files.

    See ticket #38318: Please update gtkwave to version 3.3.44
