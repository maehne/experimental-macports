This repository contains experimental port recipes for MacPorts
<http://www.macports.org/>. These recipes either fix bugs in ports
already present in MacPorts and reported to its bug tracker
<http://trac.macports.org/> or they provide new ports, which have not
yet been accepted into the MacPorts repository. That means that
recipes will disappear from this repository once they have been
migrated or have been superseded by the ports available via
"port selfupdate" from the MacPorts repository.


Currently, this repository contains the following new ports:

gaw @20130801 (cad)
    Gaw is a software tool for displaying analog waveforms from
    sampled data, e.g., from the output of simulators like Spice. Data
    can be imported to gaw using files or direct TCP/IP connections. Gaw
    is based on the Gtk2+ toolkit.

    See ticket #54222

gaw3 @20130801 (cad)
    Gaw is a software tool for displaying analog waveforms from
    sampled data, e.g., from the output of simulators like Spice. Data
    can be imported to gaw using files or direct TCP/IP connections. Gaw
    is based on the Gtk3+ toolkit.

          compile due to ticket #22066. The gcc47 variant works.

    See tickets #37580, #40058, and #22066.
