This repository contains experimental port recipes for MacPorts
<http://www.macports.org/>. These recipes either fix bugs in ports
already present in MacPorts and reported to its bug tracker
<http://trac.macports.org/> or they provide new ports, which have not
yet been accepted into the MacPorts repository. That means that
recipes will disappear from this repository once they have been
migrated or have been superseded by the ports available via
"port selfupdate" from the MacPorts repository.


Currently, this repository contains the following new ports:

pristine-tar @b74af91 (archivers)
    Regenerate a pristine upstream tarball from a binary delta file and
    a revision control checkout

    UNRELEASED

xdelta1 @1.1.4 (archivers)
    Xdelta -- A binary delta generator (old stable maintenance release)

    See ticket #35395: Xdelta -- A binary delta generator (old stable
        maintenance release)

    See ticket #35386: Gaw: Gtk Analog Wave viewer

Currently, this repository contains the following new ports:
