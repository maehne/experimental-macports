This repository contains experimental port recipes for MacPorts
<http://www.macports.org/>. These recipes either fix bugs in ports
already present in MacPorts and reported to its bug tracker
<http://trac.macports.org/> or they provide new ports, which have not
yet been accepted into the MacPorts repository. That means that
recipes will disappear from this repository once they have been
migrated or have been superseded by the ports available via
"port selfupdate" from the MacPorts repository.


Currently, this repository contains the following new ports:

gaw @20170716 (cad)
    Gaw is a software tool for displaying analog waveforms from
    sampled data, e.g., from the output of simulators like Spice. Data
    can be imported to gaw using files or direct TCP/IP connections.

    See ticket #54969

pristine-tar @b89a403 (archivers)
    Regenerate a pristine upstream tarball from a binary delta file and
    a revision control checkout

    UNRELEASED

Currently, this repository contains the following updated ports:

pdfpc @4.2.1 (graphics)
    pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application for
    GNU/Linux which uses Keynote like multi-monitor output to
    provide meta information to the speaker during the presentation.
    It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen,
    while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other one
    providing information like a picture of the next slide, as well
    as the left over time till the end of the presentation. The
    input files processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be
    created using nearly any of today's presentation software

    See ticket #57381

pdftk @2.0.2 (textproc)
    pdftk is a simple tool for doing everyday things with PDF
    documents: Merge PDF Documents Split PDF Pages into a New
    Document Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required)
    Encrypt Output as Desired Fill PDF Forms with FDF Data
    and/or Flatten Forms Apply a Background Watermark Report
    on PDF Metrics such as Metadata, Bookmarks, and Page
    Labels Update PDF Metadata Attach Files to PDF Pages or
    the PDF Document Unpack PDF Attachments Burst a PDF
    Document into Single Pages Uncompress and Re-Compress Page
    Streams Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible)

    Note: The gcc48 variant is experimental and doesn't succeed to
          compile due to ticket #22066. The gcc47 variant works.

    See tickets #37580, #40058, and #22066.
