To use the MacPorts recipes in this repository, please add the path to
its ports/ subdirectory to the sources.conf of your MacPorts
installation, which is by default located at:

/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf

The new path should be inserted before the existing rsync line to
download the ports release tarball, e.g.:

# Start of file /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf
# ...
file://<path-to>/experimental-macports/ports
rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/ports.tar [default]
# End of file /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf
